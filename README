====  OPERATING MANUAL  ===================================

----  1. Requirements  ------------------------------------

The Genensis software is provided in the form of a 32-bit
Linux executable. If you do not have easy access to a 32-bit
Linux installation, Genensis recommends Vagrant[1]. The
standard precise32 image is compatible with the Genensis
CTP-3000 software.

[1]: Call 510-VAGRANTUP.COM for more information.


---- 2. Operation  ----------------------------------------

You can analyze a sample stored in a file on your computer
by running the following command:

  $ ./ctp3k SAMPLE13.DAT

The sample will be loaded into the CTP-3000 and analyzed at
our remote testing facility. The optical density of your
sample will be calculated and printed in the terminal for
your convenience.

The default operating wavelength is 600nm. To specify an
alternative wavelength, pass the -w option to ctp3k:

  $ ./ctp3k -w 540 SAMPLE13.DAT

The default number of flashes is 5. To specify an
alternative number of flashes, pass the -n option to ctp3k:

  $ ./ctp3k -n 3 SAMPLE13.DAT

The two options -w and -n can be combined:

  $ ./ctp3k -w 540 -n 3 SAMPLE13.DAT


---- 3. Calibration  --------------------------------------

Some calibration samples are included with this version of
the Genensis CTP-3000 software. To ensure your CTP-3000
software is functioning correctly, please run these samples
and check that the values given match those in the table
below.

---- 4. Troubleshooting  ----------------------------------

Our engineers have reported that sometimes the Genensis
CTP-3000 software experiences a Segment Nation Volt error.
At the present time, we are unable to locate the cause of
this error. If you experience this error while using the
Genensis CTP-3000 software, please check that your machine
is plugged into the correct voltage and try submitting your
sample again. If the error persists, please return your
machine for service.
